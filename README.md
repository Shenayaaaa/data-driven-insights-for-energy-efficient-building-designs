# data-driven-insights-for-energy-efficient-building-designs
Successfully conducted an Energy Efficiency Statistical Analysis project for the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy using R, R-Studio, and R-Commander. The analysis applied central tendency techniques, bell curve visualizations, and hypothesis testing to identify key relationships between building cooling loads and structural factors such as surface area, wall area, and roof area. The project provided data-driven insights for energy-efficient building designs, playing a critical role in optimizing Sri Lankaâ€™s electricity demand. This was a proud milestone in my journey of statistical data analysis and business analytics.
